GOAL
The aim of this project is to develop an application that facilitates users to pay for their fares via a USSD interface connected to a single paybill.

User Stories: Commuter
Incorporating these user stories into the design of the application aims to make it easier and more intuitive for commuters to pay their fare in matatus and track their travel information. 

1. As a commuter who travels daily and pays digitally, I want a more consistent way to pay for my fare.
2. As a psv user who commutes daily and pays digitally, I want a service where I can more easily set aside money to use in travelling.
3. As a commuter who pays digitally, I want a service that enables me to track and understand my travel expenditure better
4. As a commuter who pays using digital payment solutions, I want a solution that conserves the privacy and confidentiality of my information when making payments.

One of the features of the service is that once a user pays their fare to the paybill, they receive an sms response which would detail the amount paid, the recipient details, and the vehicle details. The SMS is sent from a keyword, which emphasizes the formality of the transaction. The SMS could also contain a validation code which the commuter can use to validate their payment in lieu of showing their message

When on-boarding a vehicle, some of the details to be collected will include
- number plate
- fleet number if available (else matatu urbanym, else, a unique identifier method will be decided)
- sacco
- routes plyed.

In addition to the above services, other value-added services will be developed and marketed at a premium.
* On the consumer side, options include:
- a wallet to set aside cash to be used as fare.
- For consistent commuters, ability to book ahead and reserve a vehicle
- Data analytics to provide insights on travel patterns such as (average) monthly consumption
- Loyalty program in the form of points program, free ride and cash rewards
- Give feedback/report complaint, generate receipts and reports, etc.

* On the producer side, options include:
- travel pattern analytics and reports
- easier financial reconciliation.
- Consumer feedback consolidation to improve quality of service.
